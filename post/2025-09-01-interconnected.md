Not long ago, I found an interesting quote: _“All things are delicately interconnected”_ by Jenny Holzer. It signifies the interconnectedness of individuals, society, and the natural world. I found it very realistic, and I’m always thinking about interconnectedness in human reality, whether it’s coincidence or a conceptual connection.

I even put it on my main Instagram bio right after I discovered it. Then, the next day, while I was taking a test in my English course room, I noticed a girl someone with my kind of aesthetic. Seems normal, right? But when I looked at her Vans shoes, they had the exact same quote written on them: _“All things are delicately interconnected.”_ Like, damn.. how is this possible? It just perfectly explained the meaning of interconnections.

I don’t even know how people come across this type of quote. I never saw it anywhere except on SAINT’s TikTok. But that moment really gave me the definition of the quote itself.
