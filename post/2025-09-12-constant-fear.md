title: constant fear
---
There is a constant fear that comes to me every day, a fear that appears when I’m alone and lonely. A fear about my future, about what’s next in this life. Do people really come and go? Do they really change that fast? In the end, are we truly alone?

I’ve done everything to distract myself from these thoughts, but no matter what I do, the fear eventually comes back. These days, everything I do feels very repetitive, like I’m some kind of trained bot. I know that eventually things will change, but sometimes I wonder: what if I had taken a different path back then? Would I still feel this fear, or would I just live normally?
