title: i may be running out of time
---
For the past two years, I’ve wasted my time on worthless, useless things. I feel like I’m not even trying to reach my potential, just living my life recklessly. There are so many things I wish I had done earlier; I was just distracted, stumbled away from my life’s pathway. I wish I had been alone back then, focusing only on myself, my life, my journey. Although it may seem boring and repetitive, I think that’s the best way... or maybe I just loved the wrong person.  
Yes, it seems like I’ve learned a lot of lessons, but is that really worth it? What about all the sorrowful moments?

I wish everything had been different back then, to turn back the clocks and fix what I thought was right, what I thought was love. I never came to a realization until now... and I think it’s too late. I wish I had spent more time thinking about myself, alone, and about what I really want in life instead of the illusory love I’d been enjoying for the past two years. I may be running out of time.
