title: i’ll leave everything behind
---
I’ll say I’m thankful for everything that happened in 2025. Some of those moments changed me, and some pierced my mental strength, but I guess they were tests from God. In fact, I should be grateful for all of it. A bit of brain fog still lingers, especially since I’ve lost interest in my favorite shows and in learning new things, but I believe it’s just a matter of time.

I’m thankful for everyone, my family, my friends, and of course, God. Without them, I wouldn’t have made it through this year. I learnt to appreciate time with loved ones, time with God, and the value of good health. I’m grateful that I achieved at least one of my goals this year: cutting down on sugar, gaining weight from 50 to 60 kg in under eight months, and building my body. I still haven’t fully quit cigarettes, but at least I don’t smoke as often. The only thing I still struggle to improve is my VO2 max, my cardio strength.

I’d say this year has been completely unexpected, and it’s pushed me to set even more goals for next year, to drive myself all the way to my limits. And honestly, I just hope this annoying brain fog that’s still lingering finally goes away, lol.

For those who are reading this, set your own goals. Find the drive that will push you to reach them. Thank you, 2025.
