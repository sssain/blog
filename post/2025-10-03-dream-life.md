Having an apartment at Bay Harbor Club in Miami (yes, I like Dexter's apartment vibe). I’d set up a hi-fi music system just to blast house jazz and house music all the time, and strolling around Miami with an E63 W212 would be fun as well.

But since crime rates in Miami are high, I have another option though. Having a luxury apartment in Kuningan (or Sudirman?) would be great—both locations have an amazing city view at night. A fully standard F30 340i (chrome wheels would be nice though) would be fun to stroll and commute around Sudirman or Kuningan.
