As I mentioned before, my life has recently felt repetitive and boring. It doesn't feel merely dull — it feels programmed, like I'm trapped in a loop. The weird part is it comes and goes: some days feel normal; other days, like now, everything seems painfully repetitive. Maybe it's due to my last relationship, but that ended over five months ago. Why can't I build a new routine or change things? I want a way to break out of this "programmed" life — not because I hate it, but because it's exhausting.
