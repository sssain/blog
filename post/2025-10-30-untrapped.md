I've been trapped in a made-up mind jail, where I thought everything I’d done was special, like no one else had ever done it before. I thought everything was unique, and that belief built this mental prison unconsciously, affecting my rational thinking about relationships. It made me think that I was different, that my relationship was different, that my situation was different from everyone else’s.

But the truth is, it’s not that different. People might have experienced what I have, maybe even worse. I always thought mine was special compared to others, and that made me do everything for it, without realizing that it might’ve made them unafraid to lose me. Instead of having a healthy and calm relationship, they unconsciously started to love a roller-coaster kind of situation, where the man does something wrong and good repeatedly, just to make the relationship feel like it has “taste.” That’s not the kind of relationship I want.

Over time, I realized it was just a normal, usual relationship, and the only one who thought everything was special and different was me, not both of us. Lately, I’ve felt untrapped, finally realizing everything I’ve done. Thank God.
